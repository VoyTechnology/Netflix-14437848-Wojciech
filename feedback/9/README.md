* This looks like a type of bubble sort although it's not working yet

* I get a segmentation fault when I run it - this is because you don't check that `i > 0` before you access `a[i-1]` in the while loop

* Readme contradicts actual usage (output filename also expected)

* Put the sorting into a separate function

* Note that you only need one temporary variable when you are performing a swap
