* Works well -- well done!

* Consider more punctuation than using _._, _-_ and _,_, e.g. _?_ and _!_

* You should make more use of functions, e.g. you could put the code to read a word into a string into a separate function

* The variable `input` isn't needed.

* Consider using a map structure where you the key is the word and its frequency is the value

* Nice to have, but not obligatory: sort the list based on token frequency (see example on Netflix document)

* Minor point: I needed to make the array sizes constants in order to make your program compile with my default compiler settings.
